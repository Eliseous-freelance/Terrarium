Background
Data Science allows for autonomous environment monitoring and ecosystem correction. This can be done by identifying the parameters that an ecosystem is made of, so those can be analyzed and used as a tool for equilibrium of the environment. A terrarium requires an optimal temperature, humidity and air pressure as its foundation for equilibrium search. Therefore a Raspberry Pi Pico, a cheap single-component circuit will be used to log data that is then used for analyses. 
The Raspberry Pi Pico board uses MicroPython, an emerging method that can be used for data logging and on cheap electronics. This research thus focuses on multiple aspects of data analysis. One is how to implement a computational powerful tool that is Machine Learning analyses on a computational weak device. Another aspect and core to the idea is how equilibrium of an ecosystem is reached by defining parameters that play a role on how stable a system is. The last aspect is that this research will help in defining what components of an habitat form an ecosystem that survives. Finally, this research could be expanded onto the consequences of the changes of variability. 
Project methods
The project is divided into a few steps, the first steps would involve building and putting together the Terrarium. The substeps for doing so involve taking a container, adding charcoal for the drainage layer, fertilising soil and finally, adding those tangled low-lights plants. Following that would be to set up the components that allow for data logging and the software associated with it. Sensors allow for environmental parameters to be established for later analyses. The main Computer vision techniques allow measuring growth and environmental changes. 
Application
High temperatures have nocive repercussions on plants. As a consequence of this, NASA has been monitoring climate change’s correlation with heated plants and wildfires; using ecosystem monitor plants could be kept at optimal temperatures.

Soil water conditions also affect the photosynthesis of plants. The decrease in soil water content causes a decrease in leaf water potential and an increase in stomatal resistance, which ultimately leads to increased leaf diffusion resistance, hindered CO2 diffusion and reduced photosynthetic rate.

Subjecting seeds and plants to frequent changes in atmospheric pressure may shorten germination time, improve the rate of growth of young plants, and cause more massive and rapid root growth (ref, Accelerating seed germination and plant growth through….)

Computer Vision techniques allow to analyse and monitor different aspects of the project. Those includes, but are not limited to: 
Colour analysis for plant growth
Movement detector for plant growth and fauna

<h2>Conclusion and project aims</h2>
Our goal is to reduce the scalability of wide-ranging environmental instability problems into a small-scale project that is a terrarium. By using the small-scale monitoring it should allow us to draw insights into the effects of changes within an ecosystem, and how technology impacts the temperature of plants. This research will develop an ecosystem library that could be deployed easily.
